# About me
Hi there, I'm Franklin and thanks for visiting my Github. If you look deeply, you'll see a lot of clutter and experimentation from over the years. I joined Github when I was 15 and it shows :).

I started programming in middle school after seeing a friend build a website in HTML for a history project. From there, I became hooked and attended tons of hackathons throughout the rest of middle school and high school - getting to meet amazing founders and technical experts from all over the world (Stephen Wolfram, Alexis Ohanian, Eliot Horowitz, etc.).

For a while there, I left programming on the backburner but I am on a journey of rediscovery and pushing myself to new heights. Take a look around and feel free to reach out!
